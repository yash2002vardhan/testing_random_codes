## JAX: stands for JIT(Just In Time) Compilation Automatic Differentiation XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra)

# JAX as numpy
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

a = jnp.array(['1','2','3','4','5'])
b = jnp.array(['6','7','8','9','10'])

c = a + b
print(c)












# JIT Compilation
# Automatic Differentiation
# Automatic Vectorization
# Randomness
